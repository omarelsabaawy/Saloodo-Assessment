## Apology Message

Worked on the project for the past 3 days and missed pushing updates to GitHub

During the last three days, I dedicated my efforts to enhancing the project with various improvements and new features. Unfortunately, due to an oversight, these changes were not pushed to GitHub in real-time. This commit captures the accumulated work over the past three days.

### Changes Made:

- Set up the Node.js REST API.
- Set up the React Application.
- Created routing for the frontend using react-router-dom.
- Implemented login, signup, and logout functionality with JWT for future authentication.
- Established a simple context provider.
- Developed middleware for validating senders and bikers.
- Created a web dashboard for senders.
- Improved the frontend routing system.
- Implemented sender functionality, enabling them to create parcels with pick-up and drop-off addresses.
- Implemented logic for senders to create new parcels and fetch their existing parcels.
- Implemented frontend for sender's previous parcels.
- Developed backend logic for sender operations.
- Created a bikers landing page displaying available parcels for bikers to select and deliver.
- Implemented backend logic for fetching available parcels for bikers.

I apologize for any inconvenience caused by the delay, and I am now pushing the updates to GitHub for review and collaboration.
